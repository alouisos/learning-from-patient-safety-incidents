  abstract = {Recent critiques of incident reporting suggest that its role in managing
	safety has been over emphasized. The objective of this study was
	to examine the perceived effectiveness of incident reporting in improving
	safety in mental health and acute hospital settings by asking staff
	about their perceptions and experiences.Qualitative research design
	using documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews.Two large
	teaching hospitals in London; one providing acute and the other mental
	healthcare.Sixty-two healthcare practitioners with experience of
	reporting and analysing incidents.Incident reporting was perceived
	as having a positive effect on safety, not only by leading to changes
	in care processes but also by changing staff attitudes and knowledge.
	Staff discussed examples of both instrumental and conceptual uses
	of the knowledge generated by incident reports. There are difficulties
	in using incident reports to improve safety in healthcare at all
	stages of the incident reporting process. Differences in the risks
	encountered and the organizational systems developed in the two hospitals
	to review reported incidents could be linked to the differences we
	found in attitudes to incident reporting between the two hospitals.Incident
	reporting can be a powerful tool for developing and maintaining an
	awareness of risks in healthcare practice. Using incident reports
	to improve care is challenging and the study highlighted the complexities
	involved and the difficulties faced by staff in learning from incident
	data.},

	modified the scheme to categorize 245 additional adverse consequences

	requiring prevention or remedial action, the authors did not further
	analyze reported unintended beneficial (positive) consequences.Unintended
	adverse consequences (UACs) fell into nine major categories (in order
	of decreasing frequency): 1) more/new work for clinicians; 2) unfavorable
	workflow issues; 3) never ending system demands; 4) problems related

	patients admitted to a multicampus academic medical center in 2002.The
	authors used a commercially available search engine to scan discharge
	summaries for the presence of 104 terms that potentially indicate
	an adverse event. Summaries with any of these terms were reviewed
	by a physician to determine the term's context. Screen-positive summaries

	We used a two-stage chart review as the gold standard to determine
	the true presence or absence of an adverse event.The average patient
	age was 62 years (standard deviation 18.6) and 55\% were admitted
	to a medical service. By gold standard criteria, 48 of 245 patients

  abstract = {BACKGROUND To improve patient safety, organisations must systematically
	measure avoidable harms. Clinical surveillance-consisting of prospective
	case finding and peer review-could improve identification of adverse
	events (AEs), preventable AEs and potential AEs. The authors sought
	to describe and compare findings of clinical surveillance on four
	clinical services in an academic hospital. METHODS Clinical surveillance
	was performed by a nurse observer who monitored patients for prespecified
	clinical events and collected standard information about each event.
	A multidisciplinary, peer-review committee rated causation for each
	event. Events were subsequently classified in terms of severity and
	type. RESULTS The authors monitored 1406 patients during their admission
	to four hospital services: Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care (n=226),
	Intensive Care (n=211), General Internal Medicine (n=453) and Obstetrics
	(n=516). The authors detected 245 AEs during 9300 patient days of
	observation (2.6 AEs per 100 patient days). 88 AEs (33\%) were preventable.
	The proportion of patients experiencing at least one AE, preventable
	AE or potential AE was 13.7\%, 6.1\% and 5.3\%, respectively. AE
	risk varied between services, ranging from 1.4\% of Obstetrics to
	11\% of Internal Medicine and Intensive Care patients experiencing
	at least one preventable AE. The proportion of patients experiencing
	AEs resulting in permanent disability or death varied between services:
	ranging from 0.2\% on Obstetrics to 4.9\% on Cardiac Surgery Intensive
	Care. No services shared the most frequent AE type. CONCLUSIONS Using
	clinical surveillance, the authors identified a high risk of AE and
	significant variation in AE risks and subtypes between services.
	These findings suggest that institutions will need to evaluate service-specific
	safety problems to set priorities and design improvement strategies.},

	language processing and two using both methods. Twenty-one studies
	used automated methods to detect adverse drug events, 10 detected
	general adverse events, eight detected nosocomial infections, and
	four detected other specific adverse events. Compared with gold standard
	chart review, sensitivity and specificity of automated harm-detection
	methods ranged from 0.10 to 0.94 and 0.23 to 0.98, respectively.
	Studies used heterogeneous methods that often were flawed.Automated
	methods of harm detection are feasible and some can potentially detect
	patient harm efficiently. However, effectiveness varied widely, and
	most studies had methodological weaknesses. More work is needed to
	develop and assess these tools before they can yield accurate estimates
	of harm that can be reliably interpreted and compared.},

	In a sample of 30,195 randomly selected hospital records, we identified
	1133 patients (3.7 percent) with disabling injuries caused by medical
	treatment. We report here an analysis of these adverse events and
	their relation to error, negligence, and disability.
	
	Full Text of Background ...
	
	METHODS
	
	Two physician-reviewers independently identified the adverse events
	and evaluated them with respect to negligence, errors in management,
	and extent of disability. One of the authors classified each event
	according to type of injury. We tested the significance of differences
	in rates of negligence and disability among categories with at least
	30 adverse events.
	
	Full Text of Methods ...
	
	RESULTS
	
	Drug complications were the most common type of adverse event (19
	percent), followed by wound infections (14 percent) and technical
	complications (13 percent). Nearly half the adverse events (48 percent)
	were associated with an operation. Adverse events during surgery
	were less likely to be caused by negligence (17 percent) than nonsurgical
	ones (37 percent). The proportion of adverse events due to negligence
	was highest for diagnostic mishaps (75 percent), noninvasive therapeutic
	mishaps (“errors of omission”) (77 percent), and events occurring
	in the emergency room (70 percent). Errors in management were identified
	for 58 percent of the adverse events, among which nearly half were
	attributed to negligence.
	
	Full Text of Results ...
	
	CONCLUSIONS
	
	Although the prevention of many adverse events must await improvements
	in medical knowledge, the high proportion that are due to management
	errors suggests that many others are potentially preventable now.
	Reducing the incidence of these events will require identifying their
	causes and developing methods to prevent error or reduce its effects.}

	372 reports (248 positives, 124 negatives). The results
	
	were evaluated using standard measures of accuracy,
	
	precision, recall, F-measure and area under curve (AUC)
	
	of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Classifier
	
	learning rates were also evaluated, using classifier
	
	accuracy against training set size.
	
	Results All classifiers performed well in categorising
	
	clinical handover and patient identification incidents.
	
	Naı Bayes attained the best performance on handover
	
	 ̈ve
	
	incidents, correctly identifying 86.29% of reporter-
	
	classified incidents (precision1⁄40.84, recall1⁄40.90,
	
	F-measure1⁄40.87, AUC1⁄40.93) and 91.53% of expert-
	
	classified incidents (precision1⁄40.87, recall1⁄40.98,
	
	F-measure1⁄40.92, AUC1⁄40.97). For patient identification
	
	incidents, the best results were obtained when Support
	
	Vector Machine with radial-basis function kernel was
	
	used to classify reporter-classified reports
	
	(accuracy1⁄497.98%, precision1⁄40.98, recall1⁄40.98,
	
	F-measure1⁄40.98, AUC1⁄41.00); and when Naı Bayes
	
	 ̈ve
	
	was used on expert-classified reports
	
	(accuracy1⁄495.97%, precision1⁄40.95, recall1⁄40.98,
	
	F-measure1⁄40.96, AUC1⁄40.99). A relatively small training
	
	set was found to be adequate, with most classifiers
	
	achieving an accuracy above 80% when the training set
	
	size was as small as 100 samples.
	
	Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of
	
	using text classification techniques to automatically
	
	categorise clinical incident reports.}

	in combination modeled by soft computing was able to discriminate
	levels of asthma control. In particular, the model is able to recognize

  year = {2011},
  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {Authors' contribution PWA, EHH and LA designed the study; PWA conducted
	the literature search and extracted data; PWA, EHH, LJJ, and LA analysed
	the data. All authors read and approved the final version of the
	manuscript. Role of Funding Source Part of a PhD programme financed
	by the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Copenhagen,
	Denmark. Competing Interests None of the authors had any competing
	interests to declare regarding the content of this article. What
	is already known about this subject ? Many rare and long-term adverse
	drug reactions (ADRs) are not known at the time of marketing due
	to the limitations of pre-clinical and clinical research. ? Spontaneous
	reporting is the most important post-marketing approach to detecting
	rare and previously unknown ADRs. However, not all ADRs are actually
	detected this way, as evidenced by the appearance of unexpected and
	serious ADRs many years after marketing. ? Electronic patient records
	(EPRs) along with information technology have great potential in
	the investigation of ADRs from medicine use. What this study adds
	? Very few studies using text-mining techniques in EPRs to investigate
	ADRs are available in the literature. ? Initial studies used very
	simple text-searching techniques, while recent studies have focused
	on more advanced computer search techniques. ? Considerable work
	remains to test available systems and improve the overall accuracy
	of identifying ADRs. ? Despite the titles of the articles, focus
	was on methodology rather than on identifying ADRs. SUMMARY: Aim:
	To review studies that use text-mining techniques in narrative documents
	stored in electronic patient records (EPRs) to investigate ADRs.
	Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and International
	Pharmaceutical Abstracts without restrictions from origin until July
	2011. We included empirically based studies on text mining of EPRs
	that focused on detecting ADRs, excluding those that investigate
	adverse events not related to medicine use. We extracted information
	on study populations, EPR data sources, frequencies and types of
	the identified ADRs, medicines associated with ADRs, text-mining
	algorithms used and their performance. Results: Seven studies, all
	from the United States, were eligible for inclusion in the review.
	Studies were published from 2001, the majority between 2009 and 2010.
	Text-mining techniques varied over time from simple free-text searching
	of outpatient visit notes and inpatient discharge summaries to more
	advanced techniques involving natural language processing (NLP) of
	inpatient discharge summaries. Performance appeared to increase with
	the use of NLP, although many ADRs were still missed. Due to differences
	in study design and populations, various types of ADRs were identified,
	and thus we could not make comparisons across studies. Conclusion:
	The review underscores the feasibility and potential of text mining
	to investigate narrative documents in EPRs for ADRs. However, more
	empirical studies are needed to evaluate whether text mining of EPRs
	can be used systematically to collect new information about ADRs.},
